## Inspiration 🤷‍♂️
Since childhood, We have loved reading or listening to others' stories, isn't it? Hence this experience gave us the motivation to build a platform where people can share their stories and interact with each others' stories by liking them. But some people love to listen instead of reading, so from here we got the inspiration of building a speech-recognition-based application. And suppose we're listening to some stories and we want to share them with our friends, or we want to save them to read later! From here we got the inspiration for our other feature of sending a particular story to our WhatsApp.
## What it does 🤷‍♂️
In simple words, it's a story-telling platform where people not only can read or write the stories but they can also listen to them, save it, like them. And stories with the most likes will be visible at the top of the dashboard.
## How we built it 🤔
We built it using MERN-stack(MongoDB Express React Node) as the base technology and integrated it with some coolest technologies like SAWO-labs, Twilio, etc. The client-side of the application(frontend) is built with ReactJS and the backend consists of a NodeJS server and MongoDB as the database. To make this application scalable we've used DevOps practices. And thus everything is containerized with Docker. 
## Challenges we ran into 😌
While developing this project we've faced many difficulties like: 
1 -> While containerizing the application we've to solve a lot of issues in our services because we've made 3containers(frontend, server, database) that must talk with each other.
2 -> While making the authentication system for our login page we've suffered a lot due to some small issues but thanks' to SAWO. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of 😎
Making a project like this one in 2days and deploying it with DevOps practices was not an easy task for us, as we're not proficient in DevOps. But we managed to finish it with almost 95% accuracy as expected and we're definitely proud of it.
## What we learned 💯
We've learned about technologies like Twilio, SAWO, and even some core concepts of ReactJS. I'd love to thanks **Hack The League** for making us learn new technologies.
## What's next for story-books  🎉🎉
We've planned many features for our project like adding authentication to the entire application to provide it with better data abstraction, splitting the mapped component into different pages, etc.
